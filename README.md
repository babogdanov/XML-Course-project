# XML-Course-project
Java app that converts mssql db entries to a well-formed xml file and converts the xml back to db entries.

## How to run:
The project is configured to work with one of my local database instances, so I don't think it's worth the trouble configuring that. Instead you can look through the code (all of the logic can be found in `src/com/company/Main.java`) and we'll demonstrate the functionality during the presentation.
